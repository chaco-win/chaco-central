Overview

Your backbone project â€” the full stack of your home server, router, and network.
Ubuntu + ZFS, Pi-hole/Unbound, PiKVM, OPNsense VLAN segmentation, automated backups, and off-site replication.

Highlights

- ZFS mirror for reliability, frequent snapshots, and off-site replication
- OPNsense routing, VLANs, and clean subnet layout
- Pi-hole + Unbound with DNSSEC and split-horizon where needed
- Cloudflare Tunnel for zero-exposed inbound ports
- Automated backups and monitoring
