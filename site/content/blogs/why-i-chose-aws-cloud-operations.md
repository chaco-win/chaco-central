summary: "Why I’m pursuing the AWS Certified SysOps Administrator — Associate certification: how it fits my background, what it covers, and why I skipped the entry‑level path."
draft: false
---

For the last few years, I’ve built, broken, and rebuilt infrastructure — from on‑prem Windows domains to ZFS‑based Docker servers and automated network stacks.
After investing so much time optimizing my homelab, I wanted to apply that same mindset in the cloud. That led me to **AWS Certified SysOps Administrator — Associate**, also called **Cloud Operations**.

---

## Why AWS and Why Now

Cloud isn’t a “future” skill anymore — it’s already the baseline.
Everything from backups to deployment pipelines and internal IT services is shifting to cloud infrastructure.

I already understand on‑prem management — Active Directory, networking, automation, security, monitoring — so it makes sense to push those skills upward.
AWS dominates much of that space, and SysOps focuses on what I enjoy: **operating and optimizing infrastructure**.

This isn’t about buzzwords. It’s about **building real operational control in a hybrid world** — on‑prem systems and cloud environments working together.

---

## Why I Skipped the Entry‑Level Cert

Many people start with **AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner**. It’s a fine intro, but for me it felt redundant.

I’ve spent years managing Windows Server environments, domain controllers, and distributed services. I know IAM concepts, networking, and automation fundamentals — not from study guides, but from maintaining systems.

I wanted a challenge that **validates operational skills**, not just memorization.
The **SysOps Administrator — Associate** cert fits that exactly — it emphasizes **monitoring, automation, and fault tolerance**, not only definitions.

---

## What the Certification Covers

The Cloud Operations (SysOps) exam aligns closely with work I already do:

- **Monitoring and metrics** — CloudWatch, alarms, dashboards
- **Logging and automation** — CloudTrail, Config, Lambda triggers
- **Infrastructure as Code** — CloudFormation and parameterized stacks
- **Networking** — VPCs, subnets, route tables, security groups, VPNs
- **Storage management** — S3 lifecycle policies, EBS snapshots, cost optimization
- **Operational resilience** — scaling, backups, multi‑AZ redundancy

Most of these mirror what I’ve built locally — Grafana dashboards, ZFS snapshots, Docker orchestration, Cloudflare Tunnels. The difference is **where** it runs.

---

## How It Fits My Background

This certification is a natural extension of my workflow:

- **ZFS snapshots → EBS backups**
- **Docker Compose → ECS or Fargate**
- **Pi‑hole and monitoring → CloudWatch and CloudTrail**
- **Sanoid/Syncoid → AWS Backup lifecycle rules**
- **Local scripts → Lambda + EventBridge automation**

In short, I already think like a SysOps admin — just at a smaller scale. This cert helps demonstrate the same approach applies to enterprise cloud environments.

## Long‑Term Direction

This certification isn’t a destination — it’s a pivot point.
It’s a bridge between **System Administration** and **Cloud Engineering / DevOps**.

After Cloud Operations, I plan to follow up with:

- **AWS Certified Solutions Architect — Associate** (to expand design and scaling skills)
- **Terraform and IaC workflows** (for hybrid deployments)
- **Monitoring and observability pipelines** connecting Grafana/Prometheus with CloudWatch

The goal isn’t to “collect certs.” It’s to **build a unified mindset** — on‑prem and cloud infrastructure with the same standards, automation, and visibility.

---

## Why This Path Makes Sense for Me

- I’ve mastered traditional infrastructure.
- I’m comfortable with automation, scripting, and monitoring.
- I learn best by building.
- And this AWS path rewards hands‑on experience over theory.

This certification fits who I am technically — someone who values reliability, observability, and repeatable operations.

## Closing Thoughts

This decision wasn’t about collecting credentials; it was about direction.
The AWS Cloud Operations certification is a natural next step for someone who lives in the world of uptime, monitoring, and automation.

It formalizes the skills I’ve built in my homelab and brings them to cloud scale.

Next up: deeper AWS hands‑on labs, Terraform workflows, and hybrid automation between my home server and AWS.

Infrastructure is infrastructure — whether it’s on‑prem or in the cloud. This cert just happens to cover more sky.
