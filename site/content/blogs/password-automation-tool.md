Summary

PowerShell script used in production onboarding to generate secure, memorable 14‑character temporary passwords. It reduced reset requests by making first‑login credentials both strong and human‑typeable.

Key Points

- Generates policy‑compliant passwords (length/complexity) that are easy to dictate over the phone
- Built‑in copy/clipboard and optional CSV logging for help desk workflows
- Simple module structure for future policy changes

Future Post

I’ll share a sanitized version with policy toggles and examples for AD user creation flows.
